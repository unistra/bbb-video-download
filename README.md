# bbb-video-download

The assembled video includes:
* shared audio and webcams video
* presented slides with
    * whiteboard actions (text and drawings)
    * cursor movements
    * zooming
* screen sharing
* captions


## Install

**Dependencies**
Since version 1.2 the script was dockerized, i.e. it needs docker and docker-compose installed on the host. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker docker-compose
```

**Installation**
```bash
# (as root or with sudo)
cd /opt

## fetch source from github
git clone https://github.com/tilmanmoser/bbb-video-download.git
cd bbb-video-download

## build app with docker-compose
docker-compose build app

## create the workdir (as referenced in docker-compose.yml) and make bigbluebutton the owner
mkdir tmp
chown bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton tmp

## add bigbluebutton user to docker group
usermod -aG docker bigbluebutton
```

**If** you want to run the script for every new recording automatically, install the post_publish hook like this:
```bash
# (as root or with sudo)
cd /opt/bbb-video-download
export BBB_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
export BBB_UID="$(cat /etc/passwd | grep bigbluebutton | cut -d: -f3)"
export BBB_GID="$(cat /etc/passwd | grep bigbluebutton | cut -d: -f4)"

## bbb v2.2:
envsubst < ./snippets/post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb.template > /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/a0_post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb
## bbb v2.3:
envsubst < ./snippets/bbb23_post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb.template > /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/a0_post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb
```

## Update
If you're updating from an older version to 1.2, please uninstall and reinstall.

```bash
cd /opt/bbb-video-download
git pull origin master
docker-compose build app
```

## Uninstall
up to version 1.0.x:
```bash
rm /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb
rm -r /opt/bbb-video-download
```

up to version 1.1.x
```bash
rm /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/a0_post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb
rm -r /opt/bbb-video-download
```

from version 1.2.x on
```bash
rm /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish/a0_post_publish_bbb_video_download.rb
rm -r /opt/bbb-video-download
sudo docker rmi --force $(docker images -q 'bbb-video-download_app' | uniq)
sudo docker rmi --force $(docker images -q 'node' | uniq)
```


## Create downloadable videos for existing recordings
Use `bbb-record --rebuild <presentation_id>` to reprocess a single presentation or `bbb-record --rebuildall` to reprocess all existing presentations. For this the post_publish script must be installed (see installation).

Alternatively you can run bbb-video-download manually:
```bash
cd /opt/bbb-video-download
sudo -u bigbluebutton docker-compose run --rm --user 998:998 app node index.js -h
>usage: index.js [-h] [-v] -i INPUT -o OUTPUT
>
>A BigBlueButton recording postscript to provide video download capability.
>
>optional arguments:
>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
>  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
>  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
>                        path to BigBlueButton published presentation
>  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
>                        path to outfile
```

Example for a published presentation with internal meeting id 9a9b6536a10b10017f7e849d30a026809852d01f-1597816023148:
```bash
cd /opt/bbb-video-download
sudo -u bigbluebutton docker-compose run --rm --user 998:998 app node index.js -i /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/9a9b6536a10b10017f7e849d30a026809852d01f-1597816023148 -o /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/9a9b6536a10b10017f7e849d30a026809852d01f-1597816023148/video.mp4
```
For BigBlueButton 2.3 you have to find the according user:group (cat /etc/passwd | grep bigbluebutton)
```bash
sudo -u bigbluebutton docker-compose run --rm --user 997:996 app node index.js -i /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/9a9b6536a10b10017f7e849d30a026809852d01f-1597816023148 -o /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/9a9b6536a10b10017f7e849d30a026809852d01f-1597816023148/video.mp4
```

*Please note, that all directories you want to access as input or output must be mounted as volumes in docker-compose.yml. Out of the box only /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation is mounted.*
